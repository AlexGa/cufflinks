Questions about Cufflinks and Cuffdiff should be posted on our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tuxedo-tools-users). Although Cufflinks developers do watch the group, our posting activity is minimal. We have very little time for Cufflinks maintenance and need to spend it on fixing bugs and adding features. Please use [tophat.cufflinks@gmail.com](mailto:tophat.cufflinks@gmail.com) for private communications that cannot be addressed by the Cufflinks user community. Please do not email technical questions to Cufflinks contributors directly.
