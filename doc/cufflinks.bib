    Abstract = {Nonhuman primates represent the most relevant model organisms to understand the biology of Homo sapiens. The recent divergence and associated overall sequence conservation between individual members of this taxon have nonetheless largely precluded the use of primates in comparative sequence studies. We used sequence comparisons of an extensive set of Old World and New World monkeys and hominoids to identify functional regions in the human genome. Analysis of these data enabled the discovery of primate-specific gene regulatory elements and the demarcation of the exons of multiple genes. Much of the information content of the comprehensive primate sequence comparisons could be captured with a small subset of phylogenetically close primates. These results demonstrate the utility of intraprimate sequence comparisons to discover common mammalian as well as primate-specific functional elements in the human genome, which are unattainable through the evaluation of more evolutionarily distant species.},

@article{Bourque2004,
    Abstract = {Recent analysis of genome rearrangements in human and mouse genomes revealed evidence for more rearrangements than thought previously and shed light on previously unknown features of mammalian evolution, like breakpoint reuse and numerous microrearrangements. However, two-way analysis cannot reveal the genomic architecture of ancestral mammals or assign rearrangement events to different lineages. Thus, the "original synteny" problem introduced by Nadeau and Sankoff previously, remains unsolved, as at least three mammalian genomes are required to derive the ancestral mammalian karyotype. We show that availability of the rat genome allows one to reconstruct a putative genomic architecture of the ancestral murid rodent genome. This reconstruction suggests that this ancestral genome retained many previously postulated chromosome associations in the placental ancestor and reveals others that were beyond the resolution of cytogenetic, radiation hybrid mapping, and chromosome painting techniques. Three-way analysis of rearrangements leads to a reliable reconstruction of the genomic architecture of specific regions in the murid ancestor, including the X chromosome, and for the first time allows one to assign major rearrangement events to one of human, mouse, and rat lineages. Our analysis implies that the rate of rearrangements is much higher in murid rodents than in the human lineage and confirms the existence of rearrangement hot-spots in all three lineages.},

The server is fast, capable of aligning hundreds of kilobases in less than a minute. The multiple alignment is used to build a phylogenetic tree for the sequences, which is subsequently used as a basis for identifying conserved regions in the alignment.

The method is designed to be fast, memory efficient, and practical for sequence alignments of large genomic regions up to megabases long. We present numerous applications of the method, ranging from the comparison of assemblies to alignment of large syntenic genomic regions and whole genome human/mouse alignments. We have also performed a quantitative comparison of AVID with other popular alignment tools. To this end, we have established a format for the representation of alignments and methods for their comparison. These formats and methods should be useful for future studies. The tools we have developed for the alignment comparisons, as well as the AVID program, are publicly available.

    Abstract = {We describe a new global multiple-alignment program capable of aligning a large number of genomic regions. Our progressive-alignment approach incorporates the following ideas: maximum-likelihood inference of ancestral sequences, automatic guide-tree construction, protein-based anchoring of ab-initio gene predictions, and constraints derived from a global homology map of the sequences. We have implemented these ideas in the MAVID program, which is able to accurately align multiple genomic regions up to megabases long. MAVID is able to effectively align divergent sequences, as well as incomplete unfinished sequences. We demonstrate the capabilities of the program on the benchmark CFTR region, which consists of 1.8 Mb of human sequence and 20 orthologous regions in marsupials, birds, fish, and mammals. Finally, we describe two large MAVID alignments, an alignment of all the available HIV genomes and a multiple alignment of the entire human, mouse, and rat genomes.},

@article{Cawley2003a,
    Abstract = {The standard method of applying hidden Markov models to biological problems is to find a Viterbi (maximal weight) path through the HMM graph. The Viterbi algorithm reduces the problem of finding the most likely hidden state sequence that explains given observations, to a dynamic programming problem for corresponding directed acyclic graphs. For example, in the gene finding application, the HMM is used to find the most likely underlying gene structure given a DNA sequence. In this note we discuss the applications of sampling methods for HMMs. The standard sampling algorithm for HMMs is a variant of the common forward-backward and backtrack algorithms, and has already been applied in the context of Gibbs sampling methods. Nevetheless, the practice of sampling state paths from HMMs does not seem to have been widely adopted, and important applications have been overlooked. We show how sampling can be used for finding alternative splicings for genes, including alternative splicings that are conserved between genes from related organisms. We also show how sampling from the posterior distribution is a natural way to compute probabilities for predicted exons and gene structures being correct under the assumed model. Finally, we describe a new memory efficient sampling algorithm for certain classes of HMMs which provides a practical sampling alternative to the Hirschberg algorithm for optimal alignment. The ideas presented have applications not only to gene finding and HMMs but more generally to stochastic context free grammars and RNA structure prediction. Key words: suboptimal parses, sampling, hidden Markov model, conserved alternative splicing Contact: lpachter@math.berkeley.edu},

    Abstract = {The availability of the assembled mouse genome makes possible, for the first time, an alignment and comparison of two large vertebrate genomes. We investigated different strategies of alignment for the subsequent analysis of conservation of genomes that are effective for assemblies of different quality. These strategies were applied to the comparison of the working draft of the human genome with the Mouse Genome Sequencing Consortium assembly, as well as other intermediate mouse assemblies. Our methods are fast and the resulting alignments exhibit a high degree of sensitivity, covering more than 90% of known coding exons in the human genome. We obtained such coverage while preserving specificity. With a view towards the end user, we developed a suite of tools and Web sites for automatically aligning and subsequently browsing and working with whole-genome comparisons. We describe the use of these tools to identify conserved non-coding regions between the human and mouse genomes, some of which have not been identified by other methods.},

    Abstract = {We describe a new method for simultaneously identifying novel homologous genes with identical structure in the human, mouse, and rat genomes by combining pairwise predictions made with the SLAM gene-finding program. Using this method, we found 3698 gene triples in the human, mouse, and rat genomes which are predicted with exactly the same gene structure. We show, both computationally and experimentally, that the introns of these triples are predicted accurately as compared with the introns of other ab initio gene prediction sets. Computationally, we compared the introns of these gene triples, as well as those from other ab initio gene finders, with known intron annotations. We show that a unique property of SLAM, namely that it predicts gene structures simultaneously in two organisms, is key to producing sets of predictions that are highly accurate in intron structure when combined with other programs. Experimentally, we performed reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in both the human and rat to test the exon pairs flanking introns from a subset of the gene triples for which the human gene had not been previously identified. By performing RT-PCR on orthologous introns in both the human and rat genomes, we additionally explore the validity of using RT-PCR as a method for confirming gene predictions.},

A number of promising comparative-based approaches have been developed for gene finding, regulatory element discovery and other purposes, and it is clear that these tools will play a fundamental role in analysing the enormous amount of new data that is currently being generated. The synthesis of computationally intensive comparative computational approaches with the requirement for whole genome analysis represents both an unprecedented challenge and opportunity for computational scientists. We focus on a few of these challenges, using by way of example the problems of alignment, gene finding and regulatory element discovery, and discuss the issues that have arisen in attempts to solve these problems in the context of whole genome analysis pipelines.},

Here, we describe the VISTA family of tools created to assist biologists in carrying out this task. Our first VISTA server at http://www-gsd.lbl.gov/vista/ was launched in the summer of 2000 and was designed to align long genomic sequences and visualize these alignments with associated functional annotations. Currently the VISTA site includes multiple comparative genomics tools and provides users with rich capabilities to browse pre-computed whole-genome alignments of large vertebrate genomes and other groups of organisms with VISTA Browser, to submit their own sequences of interest to several VISTA servers for various types of comparative analysis and to obtain detailed comparative analysis results for a set of cardiovascular genes. We illustrate capabilities of the VISTA site by the analysis of a 180 kb interval on human chromosome 5 that encodes for the kinesin family member 3A (KIF3A) protein.},

    Abstract = {The laboratory rat (Rattus norvegicus) is an indispensable tool in experimental medicine and drug development, having made inestimable contributions to human health. We report here the genome sequence of the Brown Norway (BN) rat strain. The sequence represents a high-quality 'draft' covering over 90% of the genome. The BN rat sequence is the third complete mammalian genome to be deciphered, and three-way comparisons with the human and mouse genomes resolve details of mammalian evolution. This first comprehensive analysis includes genes and proteins and their relation to human disease, repeated sequences, comparative genome-wide studies of mammalian orthologous chromosomal regions and rearrangement breakpoints, reconstruction of ancestral karyotypes and the events leading to existing species, rates of variation, and lineage-specific and lineage-independent evolutionary events such as expansion of gene families, orthology relations and protein evolution.},

    Abstract = {We present here a draft genome sequence of the red jungle fowl, Gallus gallus. Because the chicken is a modern descendant of the dinosaurs and the first non-mammalian amniote to have its genome sequenced, the draft sequence of its genome--composed of approximately one billion base pairs of sequence and an estimated 20,000-23,000 genes--provides a new perspective on vertebrate genome evolution, while also improving the annotation of mammalian genomes. For example, the evolutionary distance between chicken and human provides high specificity in detecting functional elements, both non-coding and coding. Notably, many conserved non-coding sequences are far from genes and cannot be assigned to defined functional classes. In coding regions the evolutionary dynamics of protein domains and orthologous groups illustrate processes that distinguish the lineages leading to birds and mammals. The distinctive properties of avian microchromosomes, together with the inferred patterns of conserved synteny, provide additional insights into vertebrate chromosome architecture.},

	abstract = {We recently showed that the mammalian genome encodes >1,000 large intergenic noncoding (linc)RNAs that are clearly conserved across mammals and, thus, functional. Gene expression patterns have implicated these lincRNAs in diverse biological processes, including cell-cycle regulation, immune surveillance, and embryonic stem cell pluripotency. However, the mechanism by which these lincRNAs function is unknown. Here, we expand the catalog of human lincRNAs to approximately 3,300 by analyzing chromatin-state maps of various human cell types. Inspired by the observation that the well-characterized lincRNA HOTAIR binds the polycomb repressive complex (PRC)2, we tested whether many lincRNAs are physically associated with PRC2. Remarkably, we observe that approximately 20% of lincRNAs expressed in various cell types are bound by PRC2, and that additional lincRNAs are bound by other chromatin-modifying complexes. Also, we show that siRNA-mediated depletion of certain lincRNAs associated with PRC2 leads to changes in gene expression, and that the up-regulated genes are enriched for those normally silenced by PRC2. We propose a model in which some lincRNAs guide chromatin-modifying complexes to specific genomic loci to regulate gene expression.},

    Abstract = {The application of Needleman--Wunsch alignment techniques to biological sequences is complicated by two serious problems when the sequences are long: the running time, which scales as the product of the lengths of sequences, and the difficulty in obtaining suitable parameters that produce meaningful alignments. The running time problem is often corrected by reducing the search space, using techniques such as banding, or chaining of high-scoring pairs. The parameter problem is more difficult to fix, partly because the probabilistic model, which Needleman--Wunsch is equivalent to, does not capture a key feature of biological sequence alignments, namely the alternation of conserved blocks and seemingly unrelated nonconserved segments. We present a solution to the problem of designing efficient search spaces for pair hidden Markov models that align biological sequences by taking advantage of their associated features. Our approach leads to an optimization problem, for which we obtain a 2-approximation algorithm, and that is based on the construction of Manhattan networks, which are close relatives of Steiner trees. We describe the underlying theory and show how our methods can be applied to alignment of DNA sequences in practice, successfully reducing the Viterbi algorithm search space of alignment PHMMs by three orders of magnitude.},

    Abstract = {Identifying transcriptional regulatory elements represents a significant challenge in annotating the genomes of higher vertebrates. We have developed a computational tool, rVista, for high-throughput discovery of cis-regulatory elements that combines clustering of predicted transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) and the analysis of interspecies sequence conservation to maximize the identification of functional sites. To assess the ability of rVista to discover true positive TFBSs while minimizing the prediction of false positives, we analyzed the distribution of several TFBSs across 1 Mb of the well-annotated cytokine gene cluster (Hs5q31; Mm11). Because a large number of AP-1, NFAT, and GATA-3 sites have been experimentally identified in this interval, we focused our analysis on the distribution of all binding sites specific for these transcription factors. The exploitation of the orthologous human-mouse dataset resulted in the elimination of > 95% of the approximately 58,000 binding sites predicted on analysis of the human sequence alone, whereas it identified 88% of the experimentally verified binding sites in this region.},

    Abstract = {MOTIVATION: Phylogenetic shadowing is a comparative genomics principle that allows for the discovery of conserved regions in sequences from multiple closely related organisms. We develop a formal probabilistic framework for combining phylogenetic shadowing with feature-based functional annotation methods. The resulting model, a generalized hidden {Markov} phylogeny (GHMP), applies to a variety of situations where functional regions are to be inferred from evolutionary constraints. RESULTS: We show how GHMPs can be used to predict complete shared gene structures in multiple primate sequences. We also describe shadower, our implementation of such a prediction system. We find that shadower outperforms previously reported ab initio gene finders, including comparative human-mouse approaches, on a small sample of diverse exonic regions. Finally, we report on an empirical analysis of shadower's performance which reveals that as few as five well-chosen species may suffice to attain maximal sensitivity and specificity in exon demarcation.

    Abstract = {This paper describes a fast and fully automated dictionary-based approach to gene annotation and exon prediction. Two dictionaries are constructed, one from the nonredundant protein OWL database and the other from the dbEST database. These dictionaries are used to obtain O (1) time lookups of tuples in the dictionaries (4 tuples for the OWL database and 11 tuples for the dbEST database). These tuples can be used to rapidly find the longest matches at every position in an input sequence to the database sequences. Such matches provide very useful information pertaining to locating common segments between exons, alternative splice sites, and frequency data of long tuples for statistical purposes. These dictionaries also provide the basis for both homology determination, and statistical approaches to exon prediction.},

    Abstract = {Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have been successfully applied to a variety of problems in molecular biology, ranging from alignment problems to gene finding and annotation. Alignment problems can be solved with pair HMMs, while gene finding programs rely on generalized HMMs in order to model exon lengths. In this paper, we introduce the generalized pair HMM (GPHMM), which is an extension of both pair and generalized HMMs. We show how GPHMMs, in conjunction with approximate alignments, can be used for cross-species gene finding and describe applications to DNA-cDNA and DNA-protein alignment. GPHMMs provide a unifying and probabilistically sound theory for modeling these problems.},

    Abstract = {One of the major successes in computational biology has been the unification, by using the graphical model formalism, of a multitude of algorithms for annotating and comparing biological sequences. Graphical models that have been applied to these problems include hidden Markov models for annotation, tree models for phylogenetics, and pair hidden Markov models for alignment. A single algorithm, the sum-product algorithm, solves many of the inference problems that are associated with different statistical models. This article introduces the polytope propagation algorithm for computing the Newton polytope of an observation from a graphical model. This algorithm is a geometric version of the sum-product algorithm and is used to analyze the parametric behavior of maximum a posteriori inference calculations for graphical models.},

    Abstract = {This article presents a unified mathematical framework for inference in graphical models, building on the observation that graphical models are algebraic varieties. From this geometric viewpoint, observations generated from a model are coordinates of a point in the variety, and the sum-product algorithm is an efficient tool for evaluating specific coordinates. Here, we address the question of how the solutions to various inference problems depend on the model parameters. The proposed answer is expressed in terms of tropical algebraic geometry. The Newton polytope of a statistical model plays a key role. Our results are applied to the hidden Markov model and the general Markov model on a binary tree.},

The two Drosophila Genome Projects, in collaboration with Celera Genomics Systems, have sequenced the genome, complementing the previously established physical and genetic maps. In addition, the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project has undertaken large-scale functional analysis based on mutagenesis by transposable P element insertions into autosomes. Here, we present a large-scale P element insertion screen for vital gene functions and a BAC tiling map for the X chromosome. A collection of 501 X-chromosomal P element insertion lines was used to map essential genes cytogenetically and to establish short sequence tags (STSs) linking the insertion sites to the genome. The distribution of the P element integration sites, the identified genes and transcription units as well as the expression patterns of the P-element-tagged enhancers is described and discussed.},

@article{Richards2005,
    Abstract = {We have sequenced the genome of a second Drosophila species, Drosophila pseudoobscura, and compared this to the genome sequence of Drosophila melanogaster, a primary model organism. Throughout evolution the vast majority of Drosophila genes have remained on the same chromosome arm, but within each arm gene order has been extensively reshuffled, leading to a minimum of 921 syntenic blocks shared between the species. A repetitive sequence is found in the D. pseudoobscura genome at many junctions between adjacent syntenic blocks. Analysis of this novel repetitive element family suggests that recombination between offset elements may have given rise to many paracentric inversions, thereby contributing to the shuffling of gene order in the D. pseudoobscura lineage. Based on sequence similarity and synteny, 10,516 putative orthologs have been identified as a core gene set conserved over 25-55 million years (Myr) since the pseudoobscura/melanogaster divergence. Genes expressed in the testes had higher amino acid sequence divergence than the genome-wide average, consistent with the rapid evolution of sex-specific proteins. Cis-regulatory sequences are more conserved than random and nearby sequences between the species--but the difference is slight, suggesting that the evolution of cis-regulatory elements is flexible. Overall, a pattern of repeat-mediated chromosomal rearrangement, and high coadaptation of both male genes and cis-regulatory sequences emerges as important themes of genome divergence between these species of Drosophila.},

    Abstract = {The systematic comparison of genomic sequences from different organisms represents a central focus of contemporary genome analysis. Comparative analyses of vertebrate sequences can identify coding and conserved non-coding regions, including regulatory elements, and provide insight into the forces that have rendered modern-day genomes. As a complement to whole-genome sequencing efforts, we are sequencing and comparing targeted genomic regions in multiple, evolutionarily diverse vertebrates. Here we report the generation and analysis of over 12 megabases (Mb) of sequence from 12 species, all derived from the genomic region orthologous to a segment of about 1.8 Mb on human chromosome 7 containing ten genes, including the gene mutated in cystic fibrosis. These sequences show conservation reflecting both functional constraints and the neutral mutational events that shaped this genomic region. In particular, we identify substantial numbers of conserved non-coding segments beyond those previously identified experimentally, most of which are not detectable by pair-wise sequence comparisons alone. Analysis of transposable element insertions highlights the variation in genome dynamics among these species and confirms the placement of rodents as a sister group to the primates.},

@article{Venter2001,
    Abstract = {A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome was generated by the whole-genome shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends of plasmid clones made from the DNA of five individuals. Two assembly strategies-a whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome assembly-were used, each combining sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort. The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This brought the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold, reducing the number and size of gaps in the final assembly over what would be obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly strategies yielded very similar results that largely agree with independent mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes. More than 90% of the genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and 25% of the genome is in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding transcripts for which there was strong corroborating evidence and an additional approximately 12,000 computationally derived genes with mouse matches or other weak supporting evidence. Although gene-dense clusters are obvious, almost half the genes are dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large tracts of apparently noncoding sequence. Only 1.1% of the genome is spanned by exons, whereas 24% is in introns, with 75% of the genome being intergenic DNA. Duplications of segmental blocks, ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are abundant throughout the genome and reveal a complex evolutionary history. Comparative genomic analysis indicates vertebrate expansions of genes associated with neuronal function, with tissue-specific developmental regulation, and with the hemostasis and immune systems. DNA sequence comparisons between the consensus sequence and publicly funded genome data provided locations of 2.1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on average, but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1% of all SNPs resulted in variation in proteins, but the task of determining which SNPs have functional consequences remains an open challenge.},

    Abstract = {The sequence of the mouse genome is a key informational tool for understanding the contents of the human genome and a key experimental tool for biomedical research. Here, we report the results of an international collaboration to produce a high-quality draft sequence of the mouse genome. We also present an initial comparative analysis of the mouse and human genomes, describing some of the insights that can be gleaned from the two sequences. We discuss topics including the analysis of the evolutionary forces shaping the size, structure and sequence of the genomes; the conservation of large-scale synteny across most of the genomes; the much lower extent of sequence orthology covering less than half of the genomes; the proportions of the genomes under selection; the number of protein-coding genes; the expansion of gene families related to reproduction and immunity; the evolution of proteins; and the identification of intraspecies polymorphism.},

@article{Wu1985,
    Abstract = {When the coding regions of 11 genes from rodents (mouse or rat) and man are compared with those from another mammalian species (usually bovine), it is found that rodents evolve significantly faster than man. The ratio of the number of nucleotide substitutions in the rodent lineage to that in the human lineage since their divergence is 2.0 for synonymous substitutions and 1.3 for nonsynonymous substitutions. Rodents also evolve faster in the 5' and 3' untranslated regions of five different mRNAs; the ratios are 2.6 and 3.1, respectively. The numbers of nucleotide substitutions between members of the {beta} -globin gene family that were duplicated before the man-mouse split are also higher in mouse than in man. The difference is, again, greater for synonymous substitutions than for nonsynonymous substitutions. This tendency is more consistent with the neutralist view of molecular evolution than with the selectionist view. A simple explanation for the higher rates in rodents is that rodents have shorter generation times and, thus, higher mutation rates. The implication of our findings for the study of molecular phylogeny is discussed.

    Abstract = {We describe a whole-genome comparative analysis of the human, mouse, and rat genomes to describe the average substitution patterns of four genomic regions: ancient repeats, rodent-specific DNA, exons, and conserved (coding and noncoding) regions, and to identify rodent evolutionary hotspots. In all types of regions, except the rodent-specific DNA, the rat branch is slightly longer than the mouse branch. Moreover, the mouse-rat distance is longer in the rodent-specific DNA than in the ancient repeats. Analysis of individual conserved regions with different substitution models yielded the conclusion that the Jukes--Cantor model is inadequate, and the Hasegawa-Kishino-Yano model is almost as good as the REV model. Using human as an outgroup, we identified 5055 evolutionary hotspots, which are highly conserved subalignment blocks (each consisting of at least 100 aligned sites and a small fraction of gaps) with a large and statistically significant difference in the branch lengths of the rodent species. The cutoffs used to identify the hotspots are partially based on estimates of the average rates of substitution. The fractions of hotspots overlapping with the rodent RefSeq genes, RefSeq exons, and ESTs are all higher than expected. Still, more than half of the hotspots lie in noncoding regions of the mouse genome. We believe that the hotspots represent biologically interesting regions in the rodent genomes.},

    Abstract = {We have produced a draft sequence of the rice genome for the most widely cultivated subspecies in China, {Oryza sativa} {L. ssp. indica}, by whole-genome shotgun sequencing. The genome was 466 megabases in size, with an estimated 46,022 to 55,615 genes. Functional coverage in the assembled sequences was 92.0%. About 42.2% of the genome was in exact 20-nucleotide oligomer repeats, and most of the transposons were in the intergenic regions between genes. Although 80.6% of predicted Arabidopsis thaliana genes had a homolog in rice, only 49.4% of predicted rice genes had a homolog in A. thaliana. The large proportion of rice genes with no recognizable homologs is due to a gradient in the GC content of rice coding sequences.},
