			<h2>1.1.0 release - 9/8/2011</h2>
			  <p>This is a fix release to address several issues reported by our users:
				  <ul>
				<li>Cuffdiff now includes a more sophisticated check for sufficient sequencing depth prior to testing for differences, which substantially improves the accuracy of differential expression analysis in loci with low to medium depth. 
				<li>A bug in the calculation of the parameters for the beta negative binomial distribution used during variance estimation has been fixed.
				<li>Some users have reported that Cufflinks or Cuffdiff crashes due to running out of memory when processing highly expressed loci. Both programs now have a maximum number of fragments that can fall within a locus.  If a locus has more than this maximum, it is skipped.  The threshold is configurable via the <tt>--max-bundle-frags</tt> option.
				<li>Gffread now keeps the longest CDS when collapsing transcripts.
				</ul>
				<p><b>FILE FORMAT CHANGES:</b>
				<ul>
				<li>By popular request, fold changes are now reported log2, rather than natural log
				<li>The status column in fpkm tracking files has been replaced by a per-condition quantification status column
				<li>The header size limit in Cufflinks' BAM parser used to have a 4 megabyte limit.  This has been removed to allow Cufflinks to be used on assemblies with many contigs.
			  </ul>
			  </p>
			  <br/>
			
			<h2>iGenomes index and annotation packages available for download - 7/31/2011</h2>
			  <p> Illumina has generously provided a set of freely downloadable packages that contain everything you need to get started working with TopHat and Cufflinks.  These packages contain Bowtie indexes for the human, mouse, and fly genomes as well as many others.  The packages also contain annotation files (in GTF format) from UCSC, Ensembl, NCBI, and other sources.  These files are augmented with the special attributes Cufflinks needs to perform differential splicing and promoter analysis.  We strongly encourage users to download and try these packages!
			  <p></p>
			  <br>

			<h2>Cufflinks RABT assembly paper published - 6/26/2011</h2>
			  <p> Our new <a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/06/21/bioinformatics.btr355.abstract">paper</a>
				on the Cufflinks reference annotation based transcript (RABT) assembly method introduced in v1.0.0
				has appeared in <i><a href="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/">Bioinformatics</a></i>. 
				The paper describes how the RABT assembler builds upon a known reference annotation to better identify novel transcripts.
				You can try the RABT assembler in Cufflinks by using the <tt>-g</tt> option as explained in the manual.</p>
			  <p>Please cite this paper as well as the original Cufflinks paper if using the RABT assembler in your work.</p>
			  <p></p>
			  <br>
        
			<h2>1.0.3 release - 6/1/2011</h2>
			  <p>This is a fix release to address several issues reported by our users:
				  <ul>
				<li>Several Cuffmerge bugs have been fixed.  One of these caused Cuffmerge to fail with a message about chromosome sort ordering.
				<li>A comment parsing issue in Cuffmerge has been fixed.
				<li>GTF files emitted by Cuffcompare are now lexicographically sorted by chromosome.
				<li>Gffread now has some transcript clustering and redundancy reduction features, similar to those found in Cuffcompare
				<li>The header size limit in Cufflinks' BAM parser used to have a 4 megabyte limit.  This has been removed to allow Cufflinks to be used on assemblies with many contigs.
			  </ul>
			  </p>
			  <br/>
		  <h2>1.0.2 release - 5/22/2011</h2>
		  <p>This release fixes several bugs and adds a few enhancements:
	  	  <ul>
			<li>The differential splicing and promoter and cds use testing in 1.0.0 and later was broken, resulting in very few (often zero) differentially regulated genes. This has been fixed.
			<li>Many users were confused about the magnitude of quartile-normalized FPKM values in Cuffdiff.  Now, quartile normalized FPKM values are scaled by a constant such that they are numerically in roughly the same range as non-quartile normalized FPKMs.  Thanks to Ariel Schwartz for suggesting this change.
			<li>A performance issue when processing BAMs with many unmapped reads has been fixed.
			<li>Cuffcompare now creates <tt>.tmap</tt> and <tt>.refmap</tt> in the directory of the input file(s)
				with the same prefix as given by -o
			<li>An issue that caused cuffmerge to fail with a message about improperly sorted SAM files has been corrected.
			<li>Improved cuffcompare GFF support.
			<li>Cuffdiff and Cufflinks now accept new options controlling whether all hits are counted towards the FPKM denominator, or only those compatible with some transcript in the reference annotation.  Counting only compatible hits avoids certain types of bias that arise when one sample contains far more hits that aren't compatible with any transcript than the other sample does.  For example, if one sample contains vastly more mapped ribosomal RNA hits, FPKM values will appear lower in that sample, potentially leading to false positive differential expression calls.  Cuffdiff by default now uses only compatible hits.  Cufflinks still uses total hits by default, as using compatible hit accounting requires a reference GTF. 
		  </ul>
		  </p>
		  <br/>
		  <h2>1.0.1 release - 5/6/2011</h2>
		  <p>This fix release corrects several issues introduced with 1.0.0:
	  	  <ul>
			<li>The binary packages for 1.0.0 failed to include gtf_to_sam and gffread, causing cuffmerge to fail.
			<li>Cuffdiff's <tt>splicing.diff</tt> was missing the <tt>q_value</tt> column header
			<li>Several portability issues have been fixed (thanks to Nathan Weeks for the patches)
			<li>Cuffmerge's help message incorrectly listed several options.
		  </ul>
		  </p>
		  <br/>
          <h2>1.0.0 release - 5/5/2011</h2>
          <p>This release represents a huge leap for Cufflinks in terms
            of performance and features. It is highly recommended that
            all users upgrade to this version of Cufflinks. Updates and
            improvements include: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A new Reference Annotation Based Transcript (RABT)
              assembly mode has been added. More details can be found in
              the <a href="howitworks.html#hmul">How Cufflinks Works</a>
              section. </li>
            <li>Major improvements to Cuffdiff. Handling of replicates in Cuffdiff have been
              dramatically overhauled. Cuffdiff now models fragment
              count overdispersion with a beta negative binomial distribution in each condition prior to testing.
              See the substantially updated page on <a
                href="howitworks.html#hdif">How Cufflinks works</a> for
              more details.</li>
            <li>Bias correction described <a
                href="http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/3/R22/">here</a>
              is now enabled with the <tt>-b/--frag-bias-correct</tt>
              option (<tt>-r/--reference-seq</tt> is no longer in use).
              A path to the reference multi-fasta used in mapping must
              be supplied following the option. </li>
            <li>Added support for improved handling multi-mapping reads.
              Enable with the <tt>-u/--multi-read-correct</tt> option.

            <li>Trimming has been instituted to more accurately locate
              the 3' ends of transcripts during assembly based on
              coverage.</li>
            <li>Cufflinks now includes a new tool called Cuffmerge to help merge
              assemblies from multiple samples into a single GTF for use
              with Cuffdiff. The tool also helps integrate a reference
              annotation file. See the <a href="tutorial.html">Getting
                Started</a> page for more details. </li>
            <li>Output file formats have been made consistent between
              Cufflinks and Cuffdiff. See the <a href="manual.html">Manual</a>
              for more details on the new formats.</li>
            <li>Both GFF3 and GTF2.2 annotations are now fully supported
              as input to all programs (see <a href="gff.html">here</a>).</li>
            <li>Improved reporting of map properties.</li>
            <li>The programs now check for available updates automatically on launch.</li>
            <li>Upper-quartile normalizaion has been fixed to be consistent with published literature (enable with <tt>-N/--upper-quartile-norm</tt>).</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug where some splice-junction reads were lost
              in quantitation.</li>
            <li>Fixed a bug where reads landing in introns were
              over-filtered in assembly.</li>
            <li>Numerous improvements in speed for both assembly and
              quantitation.</li>
			<li>Cuffdiff now uses dramatically less memory.  Cufflinks' memory footprint has also shrunk.</li>
            <li>Numerous minor bug fixes.</li>

          <h2>0.9.3 release - 11/30/2010</h2>
          <p>This release fixes several issues that affect abundance
            estimation and differential expression accuracy, and is
            strongly recommended for all users. Additionally, there are
            some speed and threading improvements during bias modeling
            and correction. Finally, a bug which causes Cufflinks to
            crash on some BAM files has been fixed. </p>
          <p> <br>
          </p>
          <h2>0.9.2 release - 10/26/2010</h2>
          <p>This release modifies the way library types are handled to
            add support for more strand-specific protocols as well as
            adaptability to future protocols that may be introduced.
            Note that the way library-types are specified in the input
            has changed as a result. See the <a
              href="manual.html#library">Manual</a> for more details.</p>
          <p>Some portability issues, which resulted in segfaults on
            some systems, have been fixed in the precompiled binaries.</p>
          <br>
          <h2>0.9.1 release - 10/3/2010</h2>
          <p>This release includes two bug fixes and some enhancements
            for strand-specific RNA-Seq libraries: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>SAM files without headers, such as those produced by
              TopHat 1.0.14 and earlier, were being erroneously reported
              as unsorted during GTF-based quantification, causing
              Cufflinks and Cuffdiff to exit. This has been fixed, so
              that SAM files are now correctly handled, restoring
              compatibility with output from TopHat 1.0.14 and earlier.</li>
            <li>Cufflinks and Cuffdiff were sometimes producing
              different FPKM values for minor isoforms when run on the
              same sample. They are now consistent, and should agree on
              isoform abundance calls. </li>
            <li>Strand-specific, single end libraries are now supported.
              Some library type names have changed to reflect the
              expanded list of supported protocols.</li>
          </ul>
          <p></p>
          <br>
          <h2>Update - fix for 0.9.0</h2>
          <p>The binaries and source have been updated to address a
            floating point exception when using a SAM file with no
            header and without a GTF</p>
          <br>
          <h2>New developer - Adam Roberts</h2>
          <p>The Cufflinks team has been joined by Adam Roberts, a Ph.D.
            student from the UC Berkeley Department of Computer Science.
            Adam has made many improvements to Cufflinks (see the
            announcement below), and we are very fortunate to benefit
            from his talents and expertise.</p>
          <br>
          <h2>0.9.0 release - 9/27/2010</h2>
          <p>This release includes significant bug fixes as well as some
            major new features. Enhancements include: </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Thanks to the work of Adam Roberts, Cufflinks now
              automatically learns certain properties of each RNA-Seq
              library you analyze with it, including sequence specific
              biases. Transcript and gene abundance estimates are
              significantly more accurate when run with our (optional)
              new bias correction technology. A manuscript describing
              these changes is in preparation. </li>
            <li>Due to Adam's changes, we do <b>not</b> recommend that
              you supply the mean and standard deviations of the
              fragment length distribution for your library. Cufflinks
              now learns these automatically. </li>
            <li>Cuffdiff now allows you to supply reads from multiple
              technical or biological <b>replicates</b>, and adjusts
              transcript and gene abundance estimates and their
              confidence intervals accordingly.</li>
            <li>Cuffdiff will by default report testing results between
              all pairs of samples, rather than treating samples as a
              time series. Time series analysis is still supported via
              the <tt>--time-series</tt> option.</li>
            <li>Cufflinks and Cuffdiff now offer improved compatibility
              with reads aligned with Life Technology's BioScope
              aligner. Strand specific SOLiD RNA-Seq runs are fully
              supported.</li>
            <li>Cufflinks and Cuffdiff support quantile normalization of
              FPKM.</li>
            <li>Cufflinks and Cuffdiff now support both BAM and SAM
              files. Both file types require that the chromosome names
              in header <tt>@SQ</tt> records, if present, <b>must</b>
              be sorted in the same order as the reads.</li>
            <li>Cufflinks and Cuffdiff are much less verbose in their
              output by default, but each supports a "verbose" mode with
              a text progress bar for users that want to keep an eye on
              their runs</li>
            <li>In response to user requests, FPKM values are now
              provided by Cufflinks and Cuffdiff, even if their
              expression levels are zero, in an effort to make
              downstream analysis of Cuffdiff easier.</li>
            <li>The new "mask" GTF option allows you to supply Cufflinks
              with regions of the genome that it should ignore during
              assembly and quantification. Cuffdiff also supports mask
              GTF files for convenience.</li>
            <li>Significant assembler fixes and improvements.</li>
            <li>Some of the output files produced by Cuffdiff have
              updated and simplified formats.</li>
            <li>There are a number of new command line options that
              users may wish to set under certain circumstances.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Note that building Cufflinks from source now requires the <a
              href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net">SAM tools</a>. See
            the installation instructions for more details. </p>
          <br>
          <h2>0.8.3 build update - 7/2/2010</h2>
          <p> The 0.8.3 release on 6/30 included a broken version of
            Cuffdiff. This and a few other minor issues have been
            resolved and the builds and source have been updated. </p>
          <br>
          <h2>0.8.3 release - 6/30/2010</h2>
          <p> Fixes and accuracy improvements to the Cufflinks
            assembler. This update is strongly recommended for users
            interested in identifying novel transcripts. Other changes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Additional expression reporting fixes</li>
            <li>Output from Cufflinks and Cuffdiff can now be directed
              to a separate directory.</li>

          <h2>Cufflinks paper published - 5/2/2010</h2>
          <p> Our <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nbt.1621">paper</a>
            on Cufflinks has appeared at <i><a
                href="http://www.nature.com/nbt">Nature Biotechnology</a></i>.
            In a study of developing mouse muscle cells, we identified
            thousands of new transcripts and detected differential
            splicing and promoter use in hundreds of genes by examining
            changes in isoform abundance levels. The paper is aimed at a
            general audience, so much of the algorithmic and
            mathematical detail can be found in the <a
href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/vaop/ncurrent/extref/nbt.1621-S1.pdf">supplemental
              methods</a> (WARNING: 2 MB PDF). </p>
          <br>
          <h2>0.8.2 release - 3/26/2010</h2>
          <p> Numerous bug fixes and significant performance
            improvements in Cufflinks and Cuffdiff. Note that some the <strong>formats</strong>
            of some files <strong>have changed</strong>. Other changes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Expression values were not being reported for a small
              number of genes when using certain annotation files.</li>
            <li>Fixed a divide-by-zero error in Cuffdiff</li>
            <li>Various GTF parser fixes.</li>
            <li><tt>.expr</tt> files produced by Cufflinks now contain
              FPKM confidence interval columns</li>
            <li>Isoform filtering was being innappropriately applied
              when working with annotation in Cufflinks (via <tt>--GTF</tt>)</li>
            <li>The <tt>.tmap</tt> files reported by Cuffdiff contained
              zero in FPKM field.</li>
            <li>New command line options <tt>--num-importance-samples</tt>
              and <tt>--max-mle-iterations</tt> allow advanced users to
              influence of the transcript abundance estimation. </li>
          </ul>
          <p></p>
          <br>
          <h2>0.8.1 release - 2/13/2010</h2>
          <p> This is a minor fix release. Cufflinks 0.8.0 had some
            lingering references to "RPKM", which have been replaced
            with "FPKM". Reported expression values have always been in
            FPKM, this is simply a nomenclature change to better reflect
            what RNA-Seq actually measures. See the section on FPKM in
            the description of how Cufflinks <a href="howitworks.html">works</a>
          </p>
          <br>
          <h2>0.8.0 release - 2/5/2010</h2>
          <p> We are happy to announce a major update to Cufflinks that
            introduces some powerful new features and includes a number
            of performance improvement and bug fixes. Highlights
            include: </p>
          <p> </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Cufflinks now includes a new tool, "Cuffdiff", which
              performs testing for differential expression, splicing,
              promoter use, and coding sequence output on two or more
              RNA-Seq samples. See the greatly expanded <a
                href="manual.html">manual</a> for details.</li>
            <li>Cuffcompare now reports a file containing the "union" of
              all transfrags in the files you give it as input, greatly
              simplifying downstream validatation of novel transcripts.</li>
            <li>Cufflinks' assembler has been overhauled and optimized,
              resulting in a speedup of 4-5 times over version 0.7.0,
              and a <b>greatly</b> reduced memory footprint. Phasing of
              splicing events has also been improved.</li>
            <li>Many bugfixes.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <h2>0.7.0 release - 9/26/2009</h2>
          <p> The first public release of Cufflinks is now available for
            download. Cufflinks is a program for the comparative
            assembly of transcripts and the estimation of their
            abundances in an RNA-Seq experiment. It runs on Linux and OS
            X. It also comes with a tool to track transcripts across
            multiple samples, for example in a time course of RNA-Seq. </p>
          <p>Cufflinks takes as input a file of alignments in <a
              href="http://samtools.sourceforge.net">SAM</a> format, and
            reports transfrags in <a
              href="http://mblab.wustl.edu/GTF22.html">GTF</a> format.
            You can use <a href="http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu">TopHat</a>
            to align your reads, as TopHat reports its alignments in SAM
            format. </p>
          <p>This software is a work in progress - it is a beta release,
            and new features will continue to be added over the next
            couple of weeks. To suggest a feature or report a bug,
