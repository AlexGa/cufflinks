This release modifies the way library types are handled to add support for more strand-specific protocols as well as adaptability to future protocols that may be introduced. Note that the way library-types are specified in the input has changed as a result. See the Manual for more details.

Some portability issues, which resulted in segfaults on some systems, have been fixed in the precompiled binaries.
