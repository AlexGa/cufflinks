Our friend [Brian Haas](http://www.broadinstitute.org/~bhaas/) (of [Trinity](http://trinityrnaseq.sourceforge.net/) fame) has written [TransDecoder](http://transdecoder.sourceforge.net/), a tool that might be helpful to Cufflinks users wishing to discover new coding genes and splice variants. TransDecoder takes as input an assembly of RNA-Seq reads from Trinity, Cufflinks, and other tools and produces predictions about likely open reading frames as output.
