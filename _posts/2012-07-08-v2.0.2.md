This release fixes several bugs:

- Some users were experiencing a crash on exit in Cufflinks when run with bias correction. The source of the crash has been fixed.
- A few minor fixes in the estimation routines for cross-replicate variability.
- Providing the same BAM file multiple times was producing inconsistent expression values. This has been corrected.
