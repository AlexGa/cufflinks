Our new [paper](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/06/21/bioinformatics.btr355.abstract) on the Cufflinks reference annotation based transcript (RABT) assembly method introduced in v1.0.0 has appeared in [*Bioinformatics*](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/). The paper describes how the RABT assembler builds upon a known reference annotation to better identify novel transcripts. You can try the RABT assembler in Cufflinks by using the <tt>-g</tt> option as explained in the manual.

Please cite this paper as well as the original Cufflinks paper if using the RABT assembler in your work.
