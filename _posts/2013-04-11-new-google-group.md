To better handle the many questions we receive from users, we have launched a [new google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tuxedo-tools-users) for discussion and questions about our tools. We are simply unable to handle the email we receive, and our hope is that the users of of the group will help each other. While we will continue to answer email sent to [tophat.cufflinks@gmail.com](mailto:tophat.cufflinks@gmail.com) as we have time, we will also answer questions posted to the group, and the latter questions will be prioritized. Please post questions or comments to the group (if your question hasn't already been asked and answered) before emailing [tophat.cufflinks@gmail.com](mailto:tophat.cufflinks@gmail.com).
