Our new [paper](http://genomebiology.com/2011/12/3/R22/) on the Cufflinks bias correction method introduced in v0.9.0 has appeared in [Genome Biology](http://www.genomebiology.com/). The paper describes the details of the method and provides validations for the improvements in expression estimates it produces. As a reminder, bias correction is only activated when a reference sequence (fasta) is supplied with the -r option.

Please cite this paper if using Cufflinks bias correction in your work.
