This fix release corrects several issues introduced with 1.0.0:

- The binary packages for 1.0.0 failed to include gtf_to_sam and gffread, causing cuffmerge to fail.
- Cuffdiff's <tt>splicing.diff</tt> was missing the <tt>q_value</tt> column header
- Several portability issues have been fixed (thanks to Nathan Weeks for the patches)
- Cuffmerge's help message incorrectly listed several options.
